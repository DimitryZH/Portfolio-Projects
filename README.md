# Dmitry Zhuravlev — Cloud & DevOps Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of hands-on projects focused on cloud platforms, platform engineering, and production-oriented DevOps and SRE practices.

The projects demonstrate real-world approaches to building, deploying, and operating cloud-native systems using automation, GitOps workflows, infrastructure as code, and reliability-driven engineering principles.

**Focus Areas:** DevOps • SRE • Platform Engineering • Cloud Architecture • Kubernetes • CI/CD • GitOps • Infrastructure as Code • Observability • Automation • Security
